# Tesla Challenge


# While I know the contest ended a while back i'd only just seen it so decided i'd try it out anyway

# There are two bracnches the master containing source code and the most recent version containing a web version and exe

# Under the master branch data can be inputted either through python's console or through the tesla.data file in the source

# for the master branch to run you need to run math.py from the master directory and not the Output directory otherwise it won't be able to find the data file returning an error
